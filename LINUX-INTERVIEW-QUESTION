  Q1) How do you call a web service from Linux command line?

 A= cURL is a versatile command-line tool used to transfer data with various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. 
    It's commonly used for making HTTP requests to web services. 

Q2) What is the Linux command to check how much space is filled/remaining in a filesystem?
 
A=  To check how much space is filled and how much space is remaining in a filesystem on Linux, you can use the df (disk free) command.
    This command displays information about the disk space usage of mounted filesystems.

   Q3) How do you find top 5 large files when your file system is full?

   A= sudo find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5

   Q4) How would you change to one directory above the current working directory?

   Q5) How to check if a remote host is up and running?
 
  A= ping [options] host_or_ip_address

   Q6) How to check if an application listening on port 8080 is up?
  
   A= telnet host_or_ip_address 8080

  Q7) How do you go from one host to another in Linux network?

  A=  ssh username@remote_host

 Q8) How do you make a file read only in Linux?

  Q9) How do you kill a process in Linux?

  A= kill PID

 Q10) How do you redirect output of a command to a file?
 
A= echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt

  Q11) What is difference between < and << in Linux?

  Q12) What are different places which can be used to convert IP address to hostname or vice versa? 

  Q13)  What is inode?

  Q14)  What is a shell?

  Q15) What is difference between hard link and soft link?
 
  A hard link is essentially another name for the same file. It points directly to the same data on disk as the original file. 
   Both the original file and the hard link share the same inode, which contains metadata and the actual data of the file.

Since hard links point directly to the same data, changes made to one hard link will affect all other hard links and the original file. 
All hard links are equivalent and have the same permissions and ownership.

Hard links can only be created within the same file system because they reference the same inode. 
You cannot create a hard link across different partitions or file systems.

Hard links do not require any additional disk space, as they share the same data block with the original file.
When you delete a hard link, it only removes one link to the file. The actual file data remains intact until all hard links and the original file are deleted.

                    SOFTLINK
A soft link is a separate file that contains the path to the target file or directory. 
It points to the target file or directory by its path name rather than directly to the inode.

Soft links are independent files with their own inodes. They have different permissions and ownership from the target file.

Soft links can be created across different file systems since they reference the target by its path.

Soft links occupy additional disk space to store the path to the target file or directory.
If you delete a soft link, it only removes the link itself, not the target file or directory. The target file or directory remains unaffected.
 

 Q16) how do you find who else is logged into a server?

 A= who

  Q17) Can you write down a crontab entry to run from Monday to Friday at 0500, to delete all files from /tmp directory, recursively?

A= crontab -e
            0 5 * * 1-5 find /tmp -type f -delete

  Q18) How do you find top 5 file or directory which is taking most of the space in a file system?

A= find / -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5

 Q19) How do you convert hostname to IP address in Linux?

 A= ping -c 1 hostname

 Q20) What is GRUB?

A = GRUB, which stands for Grand Unified Bootloader, is a widely used and popular boot loader for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. 
It plays a crucial role during the system boot process, as it is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory 
 and initiating the boot process.

  Q21)  What is the Root Account?

 Q22)  What is an Alias?
 
  A= alias alias_name='command_or_commands'
 
 Q23) Check How Long the Linux System Has Been Running?

  A = uptime

 Q24)  What is the maximum length for a file name in Linux?

A= In Linux, the maximum length for a file name depends on the file system being used. 
Different file systems have different limitations on file name lengths. 
Here are some common file systems and their maximum file name lengths:

 Q25) Tell us the difference between Telnet and SSH?

A= Telnet: Telnet is an unencrypted protocol, which means that all communication, including usernames, passwords, and data, is transmitted
 in clear text. As a result, Telnet is highly vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, making it a security risk.

SSH: SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure and encrypted protocol. 
It uses strong encryption to protect data during transmission, including login credentials and other sensitive information. 
SSH ensures secure communication and is considered much safer than Telnet.

 Q26) You want to send a message to all connected users as “Server is going down for maintenance”, what will you do?

 A= echo "Server is going down for maintenance" | wall
 
 Q27)  How to reduce or shrink the size of LVM partition?

 A= sudo umount /path/to/mount_point

Q28)  What is the role of case sensitivity in affecting the way commands are used?
